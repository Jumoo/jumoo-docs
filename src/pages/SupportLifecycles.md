# Support Lifecycles in Umbraco, Translation Manager, and uSync

Releases for both uSync *and* Translation Manager are tied to Umbraco, so to keep things simple we release updates at the same time as Umbraco. This means our short-term support (STS) and long-term support (LTS) plans are also in sync with Umbraco.

If you want to know when support will expire on your version of uSync or Translation Manager you can check the charts below.

:::info
A version that has reached the End of Standard Support will *only* recieve security updates. A version in end-of-life (EOL) will get **no** updates, even for security.

### Active Releases

From release, to the end of standard support, we will fix any bugs, and issue updates to the software. From end of standard support to end of life we will only patch security issues.

### Short Term Support (STS) Releases

Starting with version 15, we will only develop and patch an STS version while it is the latest Umbraco version. Once a new version of Umbraco is released, all our support patches and bug fixes will move to the new version.

We will still patch any securty issues until the end-of-life date for any version. All bug fixes will only be applied to the latest STS release and any long-term support versions that have not reached end-of-life.
