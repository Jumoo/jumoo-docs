# Product Licences

Our licences are based on long-term support (LTS) versions of Umbraco (e.g v10, v13, v17). They work for all versions of Umbraco, from the latest available LTS version, right up to the last short-term support version (STS) before the next LTS version. 

So, a v13 licence will work with v13, v14, v15 and v16, but you will need to buy an upgrade to get a licence that will work with v17, which is the next LTS release. 

| Date of Purchase | LTS Version | Covered Versions |
|--|--|--|
| 16th September 2019 | v8 | v8|
| 16th June 2022 | v10 | v8 to v10|
| 14th December 2023 | v13 | v8 to v16|
| 27th November 2025 | v17 | v8 to v20** |

Licences keys are backwards compatable to Umbraco v8, but early versions are [no longer supported](/SupportLifecycles).

***v20 subject to change as these releases are yet to be announced.*
