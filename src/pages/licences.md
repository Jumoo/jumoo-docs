# Product Licences

When you purchase a licence for Translation Manager or uSync.Complete, you will get a licence key for every long-term support (LTS) version, including the current one. You can then run your newly purchased package on your existing v8, v10, and v13 sites, while wait for your v15 site to be ready.

| Date of Purchase | Available Version |
|--|--|
| 16th June 2022 | v8, v10 |
| 14th December 2023 | v8, v10, v13 |
| 14th November 2024 | v8, v10, v13, v15, |

You will not be able to use any LTS version past the current version at time of purchase. If you want to upgrade to a newer version in the future you must pay for an upgrade.

# Product Licences

When you purchase a licence for one of our products, you will get the licence keys for the latest available versions of our software on the latest versions of Umbraco. You will also be covered for any new short-term support (STS) version releases that may come after the latest long-term support (LTS) release available when you purchase the licence.

for example. 

if you buy a uSync licence when v13 of uSync is available you get licence keys for all versions upto and including v13 of uSync and the licence will also work on the future STS releases v14,15 and v16.

For the next Long Term support release (v17) you will need to but an upgrade, but these keys will then work on all the STS releases that follow that version.

---- or 

Our licences are based on Long term support (LTS) versions of Umbraco (e.g v10, v13, v17) and work for all versions of Umbraco from the latest available LTS up until the Short Term support version (STS) before the next LTS version. 

So a v13 licence will work with v13, v14, v15 and v16 but you will need to buy an upgrade to get a licence that will work with v17 which is the next LTS release.
