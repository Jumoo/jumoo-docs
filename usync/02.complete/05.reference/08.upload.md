title: File Upload Size
---

There are several features within uSync.Complete where you can upload data, either directly or between servers. When you do this, you might be uploading large amounts of data or media files and you can encounter a [`404.13` error](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/developer/webapps/iis/health-diagnostic-performance/http-404-13-website) which is 'request too large'.

To bypass this error, you can change the allowed upload size for your application via the web.config.

To do this you need to add the following to the `<system.webserver>` section of your web.config file.

```xml title="Upload request size configuration"
      <security>
        <requestFiltering>
          <requestLimits maxAllowedContentLength="2147483648" />
        </requestFiltering>
      </security>
```

Depending on other bits of configuration, your web.config might looks like this:

:::warning
This is a sample web.config. Do not overwrite your own web.config, add only the required section.
:::

```xml title="web.config"
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
  <location path="." inheritInChildApplications="false">
    <system.webServer>
      <handlers>
        <add name="aspNetCore" path="*" verb="*" modules="AspNetCoreModuleV2" resourceType="Unspecified" />
      </handlers>
      <aspNetCore processPath="dotnet" arguments=".\uSyncSiteName.dll" stdoutLogEnabled="false" stdoutLogFile=".\logs\stdout" hostingModel="inprocess" />
      <security>
        <requestFiltering>
          <requestLimits maxAllowedContentLength="104857600" />
        </requestFiltering>
      </security>
    </system.webServer>
  </location>
</configuration>
```
