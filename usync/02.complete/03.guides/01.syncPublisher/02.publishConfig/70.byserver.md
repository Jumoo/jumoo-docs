title: Setting Up By Server
---

Normally, all your servers need to share the same AppId and AppKey settings across their `appsettings.json` files. 

Depending on your setup, you may choose for all severs not to share these settings. In order to do this you can set individual AppId and AppKey settings for each server by adding settings to your `appsettings.json` file.

For example, to have different keys for stage and live servers, you might have the following setup:

```
"uSync": {
  "Publisher" : {
      "Servers" : {
           "Stage" : {
                "AppId": "****" ,
                "AppKey: "****" 
           },
           "Live" : {
                "AppId": "****" ,
                "AppKey: "****" 
           }
     }
 }
}
```

When uSync is communicating between servers, it will look for a sever specific AppId/AppKey first. If one is not set it will use the default from the `appsettings.json` file.

A recieving server will always use the default AppId and AppKey from the settings file. So in this setup, each server will need to have its AppId and AppKey set in the uSync:Publisher:Settings section.
