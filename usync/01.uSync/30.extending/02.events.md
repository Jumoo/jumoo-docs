You can hook notifications into the uSync process at a number of points. These notifications will be fired, and you can process the elements.

### Batch Notifications
These events fire at the beginning and end of any process, you can use these events to prep before or cleanup after a uSync event.

```cs
// using uSync.BackOffice

uSyncImportStartingNotification
uSyncImportCompleteNotification
uSyncExportStartingNotification
uSyncExportCompletedNotification
uSyncReportStartingNotification
uSyncReportCompletedNotification
```


### Item Notifications
These events fire before/after an individual item is processed. On the 'ing' events (e.g reportingItem) you can cancel the process by setting Cancel to true on the passed object.

```cs
// using uSync.BackOffice 

uSyncReportingItemNotification
uSyncReportedItemNotification

uSyncImportingItemNotification
uSyncImportedItemNotification

uSyncExportingItemNotification
uSyncExportedItemNotification
```
