title: Adding root folders programatically.
---

By default uSync will build the collection of folders it uses to import/export items from the appsettings.

the default folders are.

- uSync/roots
- uSync/version (e.g v16)

you can add to these folders in the [appsettings.json] file, but you can also include folders programatically
by having a public class impliment the `ISyncFolder` interface in your code.

```cs
public interface ISyncFolder
{
   /// <summary>
   ///  path to the folder we want to use.
   /// </summary>
   string Path { get; }

   /// <summary>
   ///  weight in the list.
   /// </summary>
   int Weight { get; }
}
```

For example :

```cs
public class TestSyncFolder: ISyncFolder
{
    public string Path => "uSync/Test";
    public int Weight => 100;
}
```

uSync will load these `ISyncFolder` classes at startup and order them based on the weighting.

The configured folders are loaded with default weighting and gap of 1000,

For example with the default config and the sample `TestSyncFolder` class above the folders would be wieghted as below:

| Folder     | source | weight |
| ---------- | ------ | ------ |
| uSync/root | config | 0      |
| uSync/test | code   | 100    |
| uSync/v16  | config | 1000   |

uSync will import from the collection of folders.

Depending on configuration the files will be combined or overwritten and a final virtual 'combined' folder will be used for imports.
