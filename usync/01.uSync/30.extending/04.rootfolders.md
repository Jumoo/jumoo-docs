title: Adding Root Folders Programatically
---

By default, uSync will build the collection of folders it uses to import/export items from the appsettings.

The default folders are:

- uSync/roots
- uSync/version (e.g v16)

You can add to these folders in the [appsettings.json] file, but you can also include folders programatically by having a public class implement the `ISyncFolder` interface in your code.

```cs
public interface ISyncFolder
{
   /// <summary>
   ///  path to the folder we want to use.
   /// </summary>
   string Path { get; }

   /// <summary>
   ///  weight in the list.
   /// </summary>
   int Weight { get; }
}
```

For example:

```cs
public class TestSyncFolder: ISyncFolder
{
    public string Path => "uSync/Test";
    public int Weight => 100;
}
```

uSync will load these `ISyncFolder` classes at start up and order them based on the weight.

The configured folders are loaded with a default weighting and gap of 1000.

For example, with the default config, and the sample `TestSyncFolder` class above, the folders would be wieghted as below:

| Folder     | Source | Weight |
| ---------- | ------ | ------ |
| uSync/root | config | 0      |
| uSync/test | code   | 100    |
| uSync/v16  | config | 1000   |

uSync will import from the collection of folders.

Depending on the configuration, the files will be combined or overwritten and a final virtual 'combined' folder will be used for imports.
