title: Background Notifications
---

:::note
Background Notifications are avalible from Umbraco v13.1 onwards
:::

The Background notifications setting in appsettings.json

```
"uSync": {
    "settings": {
        "BackgroundNotifications": true
    }
}
```

Will cause uSync to place all notifications generated during any import process (include contentSaved, contentPublished ) onto a background thread.

With notifications processed asyncronusly in the background uSync will continue with any import of other items and the notifications will happen alongside or after the import process.

## Performance

this significatly reduces the amount of time a large import will take, but notifications may process for some time after the import is completed. 

## Notes

1. If you use background notification threads, then you can no longer use the uSyncEventService to determain if uSync caused the notification to occur, istead you should check the notification state for the uSync notification events.

2. Notifications on a background thread may not have access to all of the elments of Umbraco that you might expect you should us EnsureUmbracoContext methods to make sure you have access to any Umbraco context's you might need.

3. The order of notifications cannot be garunteeed, Save events may be triggered after publish events, if your notifications are sensitive to the ordering of notification events you should not use the background notification setting.

4. Errors in notification handlers will not be surfaced by uSync. Currently uSync will report any errors that may be occuring inside notification events. using background notification, these errors will not be reported by the UI, although they may still appear in the Umbraco logs.
