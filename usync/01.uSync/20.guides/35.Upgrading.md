title: Upgrading uSync
---


You can upgrade uSync by entering `dotnet add package uSync` into the commandline, just like downloading it.


## Keep Your uSync Folder Up to Date 
Occasionally an update in Umbraco or uSync functionality will cause us to make a change in the format/detail of the uSync `.config` files. When this happens, we will increment the 'format version' of the files and uSync will warn you that the files might be using an old version.

 Within a major version and often between major versions the files will still be compatible but changes can lead to "false positives" when checking files.

:::tip
Checks are always faster then import operations, To minimize "false positives" in uSync when checking files, perform clean exports after you upgrade uSync minor versions (e.g 10.0 -> 10.1).
