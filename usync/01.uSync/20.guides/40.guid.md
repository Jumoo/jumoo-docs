title: Using Guid File Names
---

When uSync saves an exported item to disk, it will use the name or alias of the item as the file name by default. 

```cli title="Sample uSync file structure"
- uSync
   |- v9
     |- DataTypes
        |- ApprovedColour.config
        |- CheckboxList.config
        |- ContentPicker.config
```

This file structure makes it easy for you to identify and navigate changes to the uSync files, as their names match the items within Umbraco.

However, there are times when using the file names can cause issues. When you have content items with very long names or you rename a lot of items you can end up with quite a few 'marker' files on disk from when the name was changed. 

## Guid File Names Setting
To simplify this and circumvent path length issues, you can instruct uSync to use the GUID ID of an item as the filename. This is done by setting the `GuidNames` value on the handler set. 

The default value for this setting is **false.**

```json title='appsettings.json'
"uSync": {
    "Sets" : {
        "Default" : {
           "HandlerDefaults": {
                "GuidNames": true
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Guid File Names For Specific Entities
For only using GUID ID for one or more 'type' (Content, ContentTypes etc.), it is poosible to add them individually.

Adding Guid file names only for Content:

```json title='appsettings.json'
"Sets": {
   "Default": {
      "Handlers": {
         "ContentHandler": {
            "GuidNames": true
         }
      }
   }
}
```

Adding Guid file names for multiple 'types':

```json title='appsettings.json'
"Sets": {
   "Default": {
      "Handlers": {
         "ContentHandler": {
            "GuidNames": true
         },
         "ContentTypeHandler": {
            "GuidNames": true
         }
      }
   }
}
```
