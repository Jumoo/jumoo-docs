# uSync.CommandLine for Umbraco v16+

v16 of the uSync.CommandLine utility uses the ManagementAPI (and the uSync Management API) to do the funky stuff without you having to install anything on the server.

To install it, run this command:

```
dotnet tool install uSync.Cli --version 16.0.0
```

To install this tool globally add -g to the command:

```
dotnet tool install -g uSync.Cli --version 16.0.0
```
Then it's time to [Create an API User](APIuser)
