# uSync.CommandLine for Umbraco v15+

:::warning Not Yet Implemented
This option is not yet available in version 16.
:::

v15 of the uSync.CommandLine utility uses the ManagementAPI (and the uSync Management API) to do the funky stuff without you having to install anything on the server.

To install it, run this command:

```
dotnet tool install uSync.Cli --version 15.0.0-beta1
```

To install this tool globally add -g to the command:

```
dotnet tool install -g uSync.Cli --version 15.0.0-beta1
```
Then it's time to [Create an API User](APIuser)
