uSync.Hangfire is a library that helps you run uSync commands as part of hangfire jobs inside Umbraco.

To use this package you need the [*Cultiv.Hangfire*](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cultiv.Hangfire/=) package.

uSync.Hangfire contains helpers for the core uSync package that allow you to run imports or exports via hangfire.

To download uSync.Hangfire via the command-line, enter:

```
dotnet add pacakge uSync.Hangfire
```

uSync.Hangfire allows you to run imports or exports via hangfire. For example, to add a hangfire job to export once a day, you could add this code to a composer:

```cs
builder.AddDailySyncExportJob("Daily Export", 17, 10);
```

## uSync.Complete.Hangfire

uSync.Complete.Hangfire contains helpers for uSync.Complete.

```
dotnet add package uSync.Complete.Hangfire
```

This allows you to do more cool things, such as create a restore point, and push or pull content, media, and everything else between servers. 

### Create a Restore Point

For example, to create a restore point, you would use this code:

```cs
builder.CreateDailyRestorePointJob("Daily Restore Point", 02, 00);
```

### Push All Content Once a Day

To push all of the content and media to another site once a day, you would use this code:

```cs
builder.CreatePushAllContentAndMediaJob("Daily Site Sync", "Target", 04, 00);
```
## Specify Content and Media for Push/Pull

You can also do things like specify which bit of content or media to use as the root for the push or the pull:

```cs
builder.CreatePullMediaJob("Pull Backgrounds folder", // name for Hangfire.
    "Target", // alias of the server.
    Guid.Parse("f2b3c1d4-5e6f-7a8b-9c0d-e1f2g3h4i5j6"), // guid of the folder to start from.
    DependencyFlags.IncludeChildren, // flags (like include child items)
    05, 00); // time of day (5 AM)
```
