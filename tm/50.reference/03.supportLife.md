title: Support Lifecycles
---

Translation Manager releases are tied to Umbraco, so to keep things simple we release updates for Translation Manager at the same time as Umbraco. This means our short-term support (STS) and long-term support (LTS) plans are also in sync with Umbraco!

Our [support lifecycles page is here](/SupportLifecycles), and the [Umbraco long-term support and end-of-life page is over here!](https://umbraco.com/products/knowledge-center/long-term-support-and-end-of-life/)
