![The create set button](Create-Set.png)

## Sites 
![Translation set options](translationsets.png)

## Settings 
![Settings box](properties.png)

- Translate Node Name

    Include the node name in the translation. This means the URL will also change for each language as the node name makes up the last part of the URL.

- Properties 

    List properties you don't want to include in translation, for example a product ID or address field. 

    The format for this box is : 

Symbol | Use
-------|---
\*     | include everything
-Name  | don't include properties called "Name"

 For example:

- Ignore Content Types

   List of Umbraco Content Types you don't want to be included in translation at all. No properties from these content types will ever be sent to translation.


## Connector
 ![Connector options](defaultconnector.png)

   Choose a default [connector](../reference/fundementals/connector) to use on translations. 
   
   When selected the connector will be used for all content translated with this [Translation Set](../reference/fundementals/set).
   
   If this option isn't selected, the editor will be able to choose a connector when sending content for translation.

## Set Options 
 ![Set flags options.](actionsbox.png)
    
- Copy on Create 
  
    When you create a new Content Item on your master site, Translation Manager will create copies of that page on each language site in this Set. This helps you to keep your master and target sites in sync as you continue to create content. 

- Create and Send 

    Allows your editors to create translation jobs in one step and leaves the [Create Job](send) option on when sending. When this option is off, jobs will go via the Pending Queue.
    
- Always Create a Job

    Creates a job every time, by default, instead of letting the editor decide.  

- Hide "Include Children" Option

    Removes the "Include Children" option from the Send to Translate dialog. 

- Hide Version Choice

    Removes the option that allows editors to choose between saved or published versions when sending content for translation.

- Replace node name from source
    
    Replace the target nodename with the one from the source, so it is not translated. 
## Processing Options

![Processsing options.](processBox.png)

- Automatic Approval

    A job coming back via a Translation connector will be automatically approved (& published) onto your website without you having to review and approve the content. This option is off by default.

- Submit in background

   Translation jobs will be submitted in a background thread. This option will free up your browser and UI while the submission process runs in the background. You can still see the progress. This option is reccomended for large jobs.
