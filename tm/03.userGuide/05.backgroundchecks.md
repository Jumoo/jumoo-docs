title: Background Checking
---

By default Translation Manager will check the status of submitted jobs every 10 minutes. For some [Connectors](../reference/fundementals/connector) this will mean contacting their API and requesting the status of each job. 

You can change this default behavior in the `appsettings.json` file.

####  Background Check and Check Period
- Turn the background check setting off to stop checking completely. 
- Use the check period setting to change how many seconds there are between checks.

:::warning Remember..
If you turn off background checking, all jobs will have to be manually checked to progress between submitted and received.
