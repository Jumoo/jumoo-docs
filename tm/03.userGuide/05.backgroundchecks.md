title: Turn Background Checking Off/On
---

:::warning
In Umbraco v.9 and v.10 you cannot edit these settings directly via the backoffice, you must update these settings in the `AppSetting.json` file
:::

By default Translation Manager will check the status of submitted jobs every 10 minutes. For some [Connectors](../../key_topics/connector) this will mean contacting their API and requesting the status of each job. 

You can change this default behavior in the [Global Settings](/tm/reference/global) of Translation manager.

- Background Check - Turn off to stop checking completely.
- Check Period - How may seconds between checks.


:::caution
If you turn off background checking all jobs will have to be manually checked to progress between submitted and received.
