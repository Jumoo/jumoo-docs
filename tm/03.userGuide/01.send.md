:::tip 
Depending on the translation connectors you have installed you might see different options here.
:::

## Languages
- Select the languages you wish to translate using the checkboxes.

## Select Connector 
- Select your connector. If you already have a preset connector it will display here. 

## Include Children
  - This will send the whole tree of content to translation, from this point downwards.

## Job Name
- When you use the default job name, Translation Manager will fill in the *culture* (the language you are translating into) and the *date* (the date and time of the translation job).  For example, if the job name box says `home {culture} {date}`, the job name will be *Home Welsh 2026-02-12 15:08:57*. If you want to name your job something else, you can do it here. 





## Options

- Create translation job 

    By default this is selected, to allow immediate creation of a translation job. Deselect to send job to Pending Queue. 

Your translation provider may give you options to choose from at this point. Select what you need and continue.

## Completed
Now you will see the completed screen.
