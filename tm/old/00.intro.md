Translation Manager is an end to end translation management solution for Umbraco. 

## Overview
Translation Manager provides editors and website managers with a clean and easy
way to manage translations for their Umbraco based website. 

Through the use of extended menu options and the Translation Manager Dashboard,
users can submit, track and approve content translations without ever having
to leave Umbraco.

## Info for Developers
This documentation is provided as a guide for using and extending Translation Manager. 
There are two main areas where Translation Manager can be extended: 

### Value Mappers
[Value mappers](Key_topics/valueMapper) get text content in and out of Umbraco for Translation Manager. 

You can write your own mappers to provide support for custom property editors 
that store content in complex formats.

### Translation Connectors
[Translation Connectors](key_topics/connector) act as an interface between Translation Manager and third
party translation providers. There are number of providers built in to Translation
Manager and we are [expanding support for third party services](https://jumoo.co.uk/translate/providers/) all the time. 

As a developer you can write your own providers to interface to any translation
service you require.
