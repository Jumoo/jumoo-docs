title: Translation Set
---

A translation set establishes up how the site is translated. It tells Translation Manager where the content for your source language, as well as the target languages you want to translate it into, should go inside Umbraco.

It configures up the basic settings that are used for all the content you are translating using the set, such as:

- which connector to use,
- if the node name should be translated,
- or if there are any properties that shouldn't be included as part of the translation process. 

You can find your set(s) in Settings -> Translation Manager -> Sets.

:::note
In most situations you will need one set but some setups require more.
