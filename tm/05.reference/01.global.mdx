title: Global Settings

:::warning
In Umbraco v.9 and v.10 you cannot edit these settings directly via the backoffice, you must update these settings in the `AppSetting.json` file
:::

These are settings that can be set globally for all translations.

These are found in Settings -> Translation Manager.
