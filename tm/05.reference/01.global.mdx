title: Global Settings
---

:::warning
From Umbraco v.10 you cannot edit these settings directly via the backoffice, you must update these settings in the `AppSetting.json` file
:::

These are settings that can be set globally for all translations.

These are found in Settings -> Translation Manager.

## Settings 

### Update Links 
When content is approved, links will update to match the target site.

## Core Config

In Umbraco the global settings are read from the `appsettings.json` file.

:::tip
All these settings will have a default value and do not need set within the appsettings file, unless you are 
overriding the default setting.

```json
 "Translation": {
    "backgroundCheck": true,
  }
```

### BackgroundApproval

    "backgroundApproval": false
  }
```

### scheduleCheckPeriod

```json
"Translation": {
    "scheduleCheckPeriod": 180,
  }
```

### includeEmpty
Include nodes with no translatable text in jobs.
```json
"Translation": {
    "includeEmpty": false,
  }
```

```json
"Translation": {
    "batchSize": 25,
  }
```

### history
Shows the history tab on a job. This allows you to see events. This setting is on by default
```json
"Translation": {
    "history": true,
  }
```

### fixup
Turns on debugging in interface by default, so you can delete the things you can't usually delete. You can turn this on per request by adding `&tm=debug` to the url.
```json
"Translation": {
    "fixup": false,
  }
```

### returnToPending
Put translated content back into the pending queue if a job is cancelled. May cause conflicts. This setting is off by default.

"Translation": {
    "returnToPending": false,
  }
```

Default Umbraco relation used to link pages across languages. 
```json
"Translation": {
    "relationType": "relateDocumentOnCopy",

Ensures that block and nested items get unique internal IDs when tranlated into other languages. By default these IDS are seperate, but depending on your set up you may want them to remain the same. 
```json
"Translation": {
    "UniqueNestedIds": true,
  }
```

### CheckLinksOnLoopback
Toggle whether or not links within content are checked on translations that are using variants. By default, links are only checked on translations between two different sitenodes. 
```json
"Translation": {
    "CheckLinksOnLoopback": false,
  }
```

### autoTranslate
Saves the changes that have been made in *Pending*.

  }
```

### autoTranslatePublishOnly
Only published items are put into the pending queue
```json
"Translation": {
    "autoTranslatePublishOnly": false,
  }
```

### hideLicenceTab

    "hideLicenceTab": false,
  }
```
