title: Support Lifecycles

Translation Manager releases are tied to Umbraco, so to keep things simple we release updates for Translation Manager at the same time as Umbraco. This means our short-term support (STS) and long-term support (LTS) plans are also in sync with Umbraco!

If you want to know when support will expire on your version of Translation Manager you can check the charts below.

:::info
A version of Translation Manager in the security phase will *only* recieve security updates. A version of Translaion Manager in end-of-life (EOL) will get **no** updates, even for security.
