---

You can hook notifications into Translation Manager at a number of points. 

### Job Notifications

Job notifications fire as part of the process of translation jobs.

#### Cancelable
Cancelable events can be cancelled by setting the cancel value to true on the notification. This will stop the process at that point. 

```
TranslationJobSubmittingNotification
TranslationJobApprovingNotification
TranslationJobPublishingNotification
```

#### Non-Cancelable

```
TranslationJobSubmittedNotification
TranslationJobCreatingNotification 
TranslationJobReceivedNotification
TranslationJobApprovedNotification 
TranslationJobPublishedNotification 
TranslationJobBulkStartingNotification 
TranslationJobBulkEndingNotification 
```
### Nodes
Node notifications occur as each content page is prepped for translation. 

#### Cancelable
Cancelable events can be cancelled by setting the cancel value to true on the notification. This will stop the process at that point. 

```
TranslationNodeCreatingNotification
TranslationNodeApprovingNotification
```

  

#### Non-Cancelable
```
TranslationNodeCreatedNotification 
TranslationNodeUpdatedNotification  
TranslationNodeApprovedNotification
```
