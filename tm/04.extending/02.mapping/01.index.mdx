title: Property Mapping
---

Translation Manager comes with support for all the core Umbraco text-based property editors, as well as most of the popular 3rd party text-based property editors. However, there may be times when you have custom property editors that are not covered by the core installation.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
  defaultValue="9"
  values={[
    { label: 'Umbraco 8', value: '8', },
    { label: 'Umbraco 9/10', value: '9', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="8">

If your custom property editors store text in the same way as any of the built-in editors, then you can map that editor value by using the custom mappings section of the `translations.config` file. 

```xml
<config>
    <mappers>
        <mappings>
            <add key="MyCustomTextProperty" value="Umbraco.Textbox" />
            <add key="MyCustom.Editor" value="Umbraco.TinyMCE" />
        </mappings>
    </mappers>
</config>
```

:::tip
If you custom mapper is also used in the grid you should also add a Umbraco.Grid.[name] mapping. To cover those situations. e.g.


```
<add key="Umbraco.Grid.MyCustomTextProperty" value="Umbraco.TextBox" />
```
:::

You will be able to see whether you custom mappings have loaded on the Translation Manager *Diagnostics* tab.

### Link Mapping 
These custom mappings will also be used for link mapping, so if you have any controls that include links, you can use these mappings to catch those values.

e.g 

```xml
<config>
    <mappers>
        <mappings>
            <add key="MyCustom.LinkMapper" value="Umbraco.MultiUrlPicker" />
        </mappings>
    </mapper>
</config>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="9">

If you have a custom property editor that stores information in the same format as an existing built in property 
you can map your custom property to that inbuilt editor. Translation Manager will use that mapper for your values.

:::note
In Umbraco 9/10 the mappings are stored in a `config/translation_mapping.config` file.
This file does not exist by default and you will need to create it if you want to define custom mappings.

```xml
<config>
    <mappers>
        <mappings>
            <add key="MyCustom.LinkMapper" value="Umbraco.MultiUrlPicker" />
        </mappings>
    </mapper>
</config>
```

    </mapper>
</config>
```
