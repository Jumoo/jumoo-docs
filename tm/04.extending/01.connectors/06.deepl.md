[DeepL Translations](https://www.deepl.com/en/whydeepl) is an advanced machine translation service. The connector will send your content to the DeepL service and return the content fully translated. 

In order to use the DeepL connector you will need to configure a number of options.

### Use Free API

With DeepL you have the options of a free translator, or paid for versions with more benefits. With this option you can use the Free DeepL Translator's API. Information on DeepL's paid for plans is available [here.](https://www.deepl.com/pro?cta=header-prices/)

### Split HTML

Split any HTML into blocks before sending to translation. This allows the translation to run more smoothly, with less chance of lost data.

### Send as HTML

This will allow the API to treat richtext markup as HTML.
