### Project Mode

Smartcat connector allows you to work with Smartcat projects in a number of way :

- **Project per translation**

  One project will be created for each translation

- **Project per language**

  All translations for any given language will go into a single project inside Smartcat.

- **Single Project**

  All translations will go into a single project inside Smartcat.

> When using "Project per translation" or "Single project" some functionality such as remove job will not remove items from smartcat because removing the project could remove files from other translation jobs

### Default deadline.

The default number of days from submission to set the translation deadline. Changing deadlines can effect costs, and
delivery, you should be clear with your translation project manager as to the effects of changing this value.

# PreTranslate

Toggle if SmartCat will attempt to pre-translate the job on submission.

# Assurance Level

Smartcat assurance level.

# Project Name template

Allows you to classify how the project names will be created for Smartcat.

you can use the following tags in the template to define how the name is created.

- source : Source lanauge (e.g en-us)
- target : Target language (e.g fr-fr)
- orginal-source : The orginal source language (before language mapping)
- orginal-target : The orginal target language (before language mapping)
- job-name : name of the translation job in umbraco.

# Complete status

The status of a job inside Smartcat that translation manager will consider the job complete and attempt to download the translated content.

## HTML Settings

# Split on 'Span'

Split the HTML content when encountering a `<span>` element. Mostly span elements can be treated as inline content and content with a span element will be translated as a single block of text. Depending on the content on your site, you may wish for the content to be split on spans.

# Spaces after blocks

Depending on formatting you may find that blocks of HTML are merged back into your site without black spaces between them. This can affect layout of the html page. setting the "Spaces after blocks" toggle will ensure spaces are added to end of
HTML blocks.

### Language Mappings

![The Smartcat Language Mappings box in Umbraco.](smartcatLanguage.png)

Language Mappings allow you to map an Umbraco installed language to one used on smartcat.

for example your site might be built using the "Frence (fr)" language but SmartCat requires you to define a
more specific version such as "Frence(france) (fr-fr)", a mapping of `fr=fr-fr`.

would cause Translation manager to map all "french" content to "frence (france)" when sending data to smartcat.

## Debug Settings

![The Smartcat Debug settings box in Umbraco.](smartcatDebug.png)

### Save Files

Files sent to Smartcat will be saved in the temp folder (`/umbraco/data/temp/smartcat`), if you encounter issues
with the files in smartcat the debug file can be used to confirm the data that has been sent.
