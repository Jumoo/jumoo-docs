title: XLIFF Connector
---

The XLIFF connector is the default [connector](../../key_topics/connector). It creates XLIFF files which you can [download](download) from your Umbraco website and send to your translator.

XLIFF is a standard file format used to manage translations. Translators will be able to open up the Xliff file in their translation tools and perform the required translation of your text. 

When they have finished the translation, your translation provider will supply you with a completed translation file. You can then [upload](upload) the file back to your site to complete the translation process.
