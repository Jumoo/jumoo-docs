title: Passthrough Provider
---

The passthrough provider copies any values from one site to another. This is good for sites with a similar language base, (such as English-UK and English-AU) where the content won't need a complete translation between sites.

## Two Step Passthrough

Normally, the passthrough provider will take a translation job and move it to received in one step. If you are working with a large site, you may want to split the job creation and processing into two separate steps.

You can turn this option on or off in Settings -> Translation Manager -> Connectors -> Passthrough Provider.

When this setting is set, the passthrough provider will create a job in the submitted step. Then the user will have to manually progress the job by running a check. Once this is done the job will move to received.
