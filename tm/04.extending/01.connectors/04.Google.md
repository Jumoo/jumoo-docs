[Google Translation API](https://cloud.google.com/translate), will machine translate your job to any supported language, and return it fully translated.

## Config
In order to use the Google Translation API you will need an API key. For instructions on how to set up an API key, follow the [Quick Start Guide](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/setup). 

When you have an API Key go to Settings -> Translation Manager -> Connectors -> Google Translation API, and fill in the API Key box on that page with your API Key.
