title: Extending Translation Manager
---

## Info for Developers
This documentation is provided as a guide for using and extending Translation Manager. 
There are two main areas where Translation Manager can be extended: 

### Value Mappers
[Value mappers](../reference/fundementals/valueMapper) get text content in and out of Umbraco for Translation Manager. 

You can write your own mappers to provide support for custom property editors 
that store content in complex formats.

### Translation Connectors
[Translation Connectors](../reference/fundementals/connector) act as an interface between Translation Manager and third
party translation providers. There are number of providers built in to Translation
Manager and we are [expanding support for third party services](https://jumoo.co.uk/translate/providers/) all the time. 

As a developer you can write your own providers to interface to any translation
service you require.
