title: Segment is Missing Target
---

If you are translating using XLIFF you might get this warning.

![An error message reading "Failed : Validation Error: Segment is missing &lt;target&gt; #/f=f1/g=g1/g=g2/u=u1 - [Line: 6] [Id:u1]".](errorXLIFF.png)

This is because XLIFF files have a specific format for translation. Untranslated values in an XLIFF file are generated with a `<source>` tag. The translated values should have a `<target>` tag.

For example, an XLIFF file generated by Translation Manager will look like this:

```xml
<unit id="u1" name="114|Umbraco.Textbox">
  <segment>
    <source>About Us</source>
  </segment>
</unit>
```
and the translated file will look like this:

```xml
<unit id="u1" name="114|Umbraco.Textbox">
  <segment>
    <source>About Us</source>
    <target>Ã€ propos de nous</target>
  </segment>
</unit>
```

If Translation Manager cannot find a `target` value for any of your `source` values, it will give you this error. To fix it, you can double check your translated files. At the end of your error, it should tell you which line and ID is missing a target value (e.g "[Line: 6] [Id:u1]"). You can use this to track down exactly where you need to make the changes.

You could also fix this error by changing the config settings for the connector so it will get translated values from source and not target.

:::tip
Putting your translated values into a target tag is reccomended, so you can easily see if anything has been missed.

Most translators and translation companies have software that will handle the XLIFF format for them, generating files with the translated values in the `<target>` tag.
