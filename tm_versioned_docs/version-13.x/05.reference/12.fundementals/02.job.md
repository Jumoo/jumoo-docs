title: Translation Job
---

A translation job is what Translation Manager creates for handling the translation of content between languages. 

A translation job will have some basic settings, such as:
- name,
- source language,
- target language,
- and when it was created. 

It will also contain the settings required by the [Connector](connector) for sending and receiving the translation job.

The [Translation Nodes](node) within a translation job represent the individual content pages that are being translated by the job. 

Translation jobs can have several states: 

State | Note 
------|----------
Submitted | Job has been created and nodes added, and then sent to the translation connector.
Received | Job has come back from the translation connector, and now contains the translated content.
Approved | The content has been approved and moved back into Umbraco.
Closed | The translation job has been closed (not approved).
