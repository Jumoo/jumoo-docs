The Lionbridge connector allows you to connect your Umbraco installation to the [Lionbridge](https://www.lionbridge.com/) translation platform.

## Install the Lionbridge Connector

The Liobridge connector has been written for Translation Manager v9 and v10. This connector will work on Umbraco 8, Umbraco 9, and Umbraco 10.

You can install the connector via the command line: 

```cli
dotnet add package Jumoo.TranslationManager.Lionbridge
```

or nuget package manager:

```cls
install-package Jumoo.TranslationManager.Lionbridge
```

## Settings

Once you enter your licence key, for which you should consult your Lionbridge project manager, you will be able to see the Languagewire connector settings page.

### Language Mappings

You should consult with your Lionbridge project manager on HTML configuration and language mappings as these can be used to tweak how information is sent to Lionbridge.
