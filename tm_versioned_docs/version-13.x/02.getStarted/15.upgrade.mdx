title: Upgrading Translation Manager
---


You can upgrade Translation Manager via the commandline or editing your project (.csproj) file directly.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
  defaultValue="core"
  values={[
    { label: 'Dotnet', value: 'core', },
    { label: 'Package Reference', value: 'pm', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="pm">

```cli
<PackageReference Include="Jumoo.TranslationManager" Version="13.*" />
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="core">

```cli
dotnet add package Jumoo.TranslationManager
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Finishing Jobs

We don't reccomend that you upgrade Translation Manager with jobs in their submitted state. 

Usually, upgrades don't change internal data, but occasionally they do, so it is much safer not to have open jobs when you upgrade.
