title: Enable Background Processing
---

There is a setting you can add to your appsettings.json file, which will allow you to approve a job as a backrgound process. 

Add this:

``` 
  "Translation": {
    "backgroundApproval": true,
  }
```

to your appsettings.json file, and after you've approved a translation job it will show you this banner:

You can then do other tasks in Umbraco while your job processes in the background. 

This setting is convenient if you are processing a large job with a lot of files.
