title: Translation Node
---

A translation node handles the text that is to be translated. 

Translation Manager will create translation nodes from Umbraco content. A translation node contains the text elements of the Umbraco content page that will need to be translated, as well as some metadata that can be used to put the text back into the target Umbraco pages when the translation is returned.
