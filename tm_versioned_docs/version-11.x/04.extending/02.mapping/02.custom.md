title: Custom mappers
---

If the configuration options for mappers do not fit your needs, you can write your own custom mappers by creating a class that implements the `IValueMapper` interface.


A class implementing the `IValueMapper` interface will be discovered by Translation Manager, and used where an editor alias matches that of a given property editor.

We have some example code to help you, should you need to write your own mapper:
