title: Command Basics

The uSync command has some things that are the same regardless of the commands you use.

## Command line 

uSync commands all follow the same pattern.

```
uSync [command] [options]
```

Running `uSync -h` will give you a list of available commands. 

## Remote commands 
Commands that connect to a remote server always need a way to authenticate with that server. 

At the moment there are two ways to authenticate a command: 

### Basic 
Basic authentication uses an Umbraco username and password to connect to the remote server. 

```
uSync [command] [options] -user <username> -pass <password> 
```

The uSync commandline will use the supplied username and password to login to the Umbraco website. 

### HMAC
HMAC authentication uses a shared key to sign all communications between the command line and the site, this will be used to authorize the command on the Umbraco site. 

```
uSync [command] [options] -key <HMAC-KEY-VALUE>
```

The HMAC key needs to exist in the `appsettings.json` of the target site, and can be generated with the 
`usync key-gen` command.
