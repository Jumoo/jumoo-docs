title: Support Lifecycles

uSync releases are tied to Umbraco, so to keep things simple we release updates for uSync at the same time as Umbraco. This means our short-term support (STS) and long-term support (LTS) plans are also in sync with Umbraco!

If you want to know when support will expire on your version of uSync you can check the charts below.

:::info
A version of uSync that has reached the End of Standard Support will *only* recieve security updates. A version of uSync in end-of-life (EOL) will get **no** updates, even for security.
