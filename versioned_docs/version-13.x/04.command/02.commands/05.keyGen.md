title: Key Gen
---

# Operation
Key Gen will generate a new HMAC key value that you can enter into your appsettings.json file if you want to use HMAC based authentication between your commandline and the Umbraco instance. 

```
usync key-gen
```

Output
```
  *** uSync Command Line ***

Key: iQi/kIMp5ggCc5DxOORVaA5kvuvaE8NRkB7uFxTRRLo=

You will need to set this key in your servers appsetting.json file

"uSync": {
  "Commands": {
    "Enabled": "hmac",
    "key": "iQi/kIMp5ggCc5DxOORVaA5kvuvaE8NRkB7uFxTRRLo="
  }
}

When running commands this value should make up the -key part of the command e.g
 > uSync run info -s servername -k iQi/kIMp5ggCc5DxOORVaA5kvuvaE8NRkB7uFxTRRLo=
```
