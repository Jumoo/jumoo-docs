title: Exclude/Include Content
---

Excluding and Including are both useful tools to make sure uSync only syncs the content you need it to.

## Exclude 
Excluding content means that uSync will ignore anything that you told it to exclude. This allows you to leave out the extra bits you don't want to sync. 

```json title="appsettings.json" 
  "uSync": {
    "Sets": {
      "Default": {
        "Handlers": {
          "ContentHandler": {
            "Settings": {
              "Exclude": "/Exclude",
              "RulesOnExport": "False"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
```

## Include
Including is sort of like the opposite, you can Include whatever content you want and only that content will sync. This is better if you have a lot of extra bits you dont want, and only a few bits you do want. 

```json title="appsettings.json" 
  "uSync": {
    "Sets": {
      "Default": {
        "Handlers": {
          "ContentHandler": {
            "Settings": {
              "Include": "/Include",
              "RulesOnExport": "False"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
```

## RulesOnExport
These settings will only apply to exports, unless RulesOnImport is set to true. This setting is set to false by default.
